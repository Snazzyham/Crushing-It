#I'm Crushing It.
Do you hate when people ask you what your New Year's Resolution is and you can't think of a sarcastic and snarky response quickly enough? This is the solution for you.

I'm crushing it is a New Year's Resolution generator that's aimed at poking fun at those who identify millennial's and hipster. This is by no means meant to offend anyone, we just had some tech we had built out for another project and thought of making something for the fun of it. You can read more about why and how we built this app [here.](http://blog.snazzyham.com/crushit)

This app was built as part of my time at [Percolate Galactic](http://wearepercolate.com), and features content that the team came up with. The front end of the app/site is a modification of a theme created by StartBootstrap. 

Special thanks to Harry Oliver.
